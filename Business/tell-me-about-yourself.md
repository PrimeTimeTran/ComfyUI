“Tell me about yourself”

I’m Loi and I’ve been in IT for 8 years with various titles from instructor to solution architect
I got into IT after spending a few years working dead end jobs and going nowhere. I decided to go back to school and improve myself so that I could build a better future for my friends, family and self.
Currently I’m working as a full stack developer for a tele medical web app ScanLabMR. Here I define api end points, write db queries and create user interfaces using mostly NodeJS & Vue
I’m looking for the chance to build the next generation of apps which contribute to a more connected world. I also want to have the opportunity to lead teams

I’m Loi and I’ve been in IT for close to a decade now.
I didn’t have good positive role models growing up so I didn’t go to college immediately after high school, I didn’t even apply to a single one.
However I ended up in IT after taking a step back, evaluating my life, and realizing my life wasn’t going anywhere.
I did some research and came to the conclusion that IT would be an avenue that would allow me to build the type of future I want for my friends, family and self.

Most recently I was a full stack developer at BlueTread, a consulting firm. There I built mobile apps using React Native, JS & TS, and more. I also did full stack work consisting of building admin portals, troubleshooting db queries, meeting with & understanding stakeholder pain points & much more.Lastly I did administrative work such as participated in SCRUM/AGILE meetings, pair programming, code review, and more.

I’m looking forward to utilizing my skills to help build/extend the next generation of apps which foster a well connected world.
