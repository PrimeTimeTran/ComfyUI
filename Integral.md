## Key Points

- Inverse of derivative.
- Also info about equation.
- Area between line & horizontal axis.


# The Area Problem
What is the area $A(a,b)$ below the graph $y=f(x) \geq 0$, above the x-axis, and between $x=a$, and $x=b$?






Velocity is the integral of acceleration & position is the integral of velocity
## [[Integrations]]
- Adding up tiny bits. 
- The inverse of the derivatives
  $$\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \,dx$$
Power Rule for Integrals

$$\int[ \, x^n  ]dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$$

## Integration

Most common trigometric expressions.

[[Derivatives of Angles]]
- sin(x) -> cos(x)
- cos(x) -> -sin(x)
- -sin(x)-> -cos(x)
- -cos(x) -> sin(x)
- tan(x) -> sec^2(x)
- sec(x) -> sec(x)tan(x)
