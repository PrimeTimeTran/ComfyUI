### Concrete
- Limits
	- Learn how to find "incalculable" values.
		- Cannot divide by $0$.
		- $2/0$ is not possible
	- An equation which can be graphed. 
		- We can learn the slope of a point by looking at surrounding points.
- Derivatives
	- Slope of the tangent line at that point, x
	- 
- Integrations
	- Adding up tiny bits of a quantity

Ways to evaluate a limit
Analytically
Graphically

Evaluating limits analytically
Try factoring
If complex fraction then multiply top & bottom by common denominator of the numerator
If fraction with a sqrt then multiply top & bottom by conjugate of the sqrt factor
