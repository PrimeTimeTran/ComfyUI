  - Time
    - Part Time? Full Time? Night & Day 24/7? Elon Musk?
- What is your personal financial situation? Are you willing to work for free and live on your savings? For how long? If you'll need a salary to work on this full-time (either now or at some point), how much do you need to feel comfortable? Will either of us put money into the company?
- What do you think the corporate work culture should be?
  - Should we have a set working time everyone should be available or should we be more less rigid and schedule “checkups” where we huddle up and report to each other/collect feedback?
