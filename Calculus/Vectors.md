# Tensors

- Scalars
- Vectors
- Force vector + another vector(orientation) -> stress:
  - This is a 2nd order tensor.

# Scalars

- Quantity with magnitude.
- How much of something.
- Examples:
  - Distance between us.
  - Temperature of environment.

# Vectors

- Everything in scalar.
- Displacement.
- Addition of direction.

- To navigate we need:
  - Distance to go.
  - Direction to go, displacement.
- Vector doesn't change based on perspective:
  - Invariant from coordinate system perspective

## Coordinate Basis

- Elements in array as individual letters.
  - Like letters only mean something in a word.
- Two different arrays can represent the same vector.
- Array's describe vector:
  - Array alone doesn't completely describe.
  - Needs basis to give context.
- x & y

## Physics

Length & Direction

## Computer Science

- Ordered list of numbers
- Dimensions are the length
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix} 2600ft^2 \\ \, $300,000 \, \end{bmatrix}
  $$

## Mathmatician

- Adding
- Multiplying
