Velocity is the integral of acceleration & position is the integral of velocity
### Indefinite Integral
$$\int$$

### Definite Integral
$$\int_{a}^{b}$$
### Definition of Definite Integral
$$
\begin{aligned} \int_a^b f(x) d x & =\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \operatorname{RS}(f, a, b, n) \\ & =\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f\left(a+i \cdot \frac{b-a}{n}\right)\left(\frac{b-a}{n}\right) .\end{aligned}$
$$

The notation is supposed to suggest the limit of the Riemann sums:
- the summation symbol $\sum$ becomes $\int$, which is a curved $\mathbf{s}$ for sum, and
- the interval size $\left(\frac{b-a}{n}\right)$ becomes $d x$, which represents the length of an infinitely small interval.

Also, note that $x$ here is just a dummy variable - we could just as easily write this as
$$
\int_a^b f(t) d t .
$$
### [[Integrations]]

Power Rule for Integrals. 
Add one to the exponentn & divide by that expression. 
$$\int[ \, x^n  ]dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}$$

### [[Riemann Sum]]
$\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x_i$
