### What is a vector?

Vectors can describe any quantity with magnitude and direction.
In fact, vectors are often defined by these properties and are used to solve important problems such as the physics of motion.

Vectors obey associativity and commutativity when they’re added.

scalar multiplication

We now extract the full definition of “vector” from all the lessons we learned studying planar arrows.

Suppose a set V has the following properties:

V has addition and scalar multiplication operations that are commutative, associative, and distributive.
V has a zero vector, which is an object that can be added to anything in
V without changing it, just like the real number 0. 0.

Multiplying any element in V by the real number 1 doesn't change that element.
In other words, V, a vector space and its elements vectors.

#### Review

- What is a vector space?
- The commutative property states that the order in which we perform addition or multiplication does not matter. Therefore,

### Waves as abstract vectors

Waves are all around us. Light waves bounce off objects and into our eyes, allowing us to see; compression waves in the air allow us to hear.
It turns out that waves and the geometric arrows of the last lesson have a lot in common: they're both vectors!

#### Properties of Vector Space

- Additive associativity: ∣ u ⟩ + ( ∣ v ⟩ + ∣ w ⟩ ) = ( ∣ u ⟩ + ∣ v ⟩ ) + ∣ w ⟩ ∣u⟩+(∣v⟩+∣w⟩)=(∣u⟩+∣v⟩)+∣w⟩
- Multiplicative associativity: a ( b ∣ v ⟩ ) = ( a b ) ∣ v ⟩ a(b∣v⟩)=(ab)∣v⟩
- Additive commutativity: ∣ v ⟩ + ∣ w ⟩ = ∣ w ⟩ + ∣ v ⟩ ∣v⟩+∣w⟩=∣w⟩+∣v⟩
- Existence of ∣ 0 ⟩ ∣0⟩: ∣ v ⟩ + ∣ 0 ⟩ = ∣ v ⟩ , ∣ v ⟩ + ( − 1 ) ∣ v ⟩ = ∣ 0 ⟩ ∣v⟩+∣0⟩=∣v⟩,∣v⟩+(−1)∣v⟩=∣0⟩
- Multiplicative identity: 1 ∣ v ⟩ = ∣ v ⟩ 1∣v⟩=∣v⟩ for all elements in V V
- Scalar distributivity: a ( ∣ v ⟩ + ∣ w ⟩ ) = a ∣ v ⟩ + a ∣ w ⟩ a(∣v⟩+∣w⟩)=a∣v⟩+a∣w⟩
- Vector distributivity: ( a + b ) ∣ v ⟩ = a ∣ v ⟩ + b ∣ v ⟩ (a+b)∣v⟩=a∣v⟩+b∣v⟩

The amplitude is the vertical distance from the midline of a sine or cosine wave to a maximum or minimum of the wave.

### Why vector spaces

Waves have a lot of nice properties that make them easy to analyze.

So when a scientist or engineer needs to analyze a signal that's not exactly a wave, they often approximate it as a wave.

It turns out that vector spaces show us the best possible way to do this.

- A signal is the process and result of transmitting data. Any signal of interest to a scientist is a real-valued function f of time t. Let's call the set of all such functions F . F.

#### Review

- Cartesian planes can contain vector spaces. They're used to plot vectors
