# Calculus in a Nutshell

- Rates of change
  Calculus describes one of the most fundamental aspects of the physical world: how things change over time. To make use of it, we describe problems in terms of functions and their graphs.

  As the sides of a square grow at a constant rate, its area grows faster and faster. While we can approximate that rate over an interval, weâ€™ll need new tools to find how it's changing at any single moment.
