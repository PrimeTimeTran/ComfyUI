## Electrical Components
The parts that give a circuit board life.

- Resisters
	- Pressurizes voltage / reduces current
- Capacitors
	- Filtering power supply lines
	- Tuning resonant circuits
	- Blocking DC current while sending AC signals
	- Store & release electrical charge to even out flow of current
- Inductors
- Diodes
	- Conduct electricity in one direction. Lights
- Transistors
	- Amplify, switches,
### Types

- Active
	- Rely on a source of energy
	- Transistors, diodes
- Passive
	- Cannot introduce net energy into the circuit.
	- Resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers
