# Introduction

I'm inspired by [Web Dev Cody](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevCody).
He freestyle codes while livestreaming.
Like many others I'm engaged because of his calm demeanor, insightful content & inside scoop.
I hope to take page out of his book and do one better.
## Content

In Turboship Livestreams #1 I'll setup Turboship's auto generated projects as POC.

By the end of it the viewer should understand how to download src, install dependencies, fix known issues & run the generated projects.
The viewer should also have an idea of what files they'll have to touch, commands they'll need to run, and software they'll need to use in order to build with Nuxt3, Flutter, & React Native
## Goals
