## Visualizing

Choosing the right visualization is key

- Types:
  - Bar:
    - Compare values against each other
  - Pie:
    - Compare values against the total
  - Scatter:
    - Compare two variables against each other.
  - Histogram:
    - Continuous variables
    - Age: days, hours, seconds
    - Many possible values
    - Categorize values into groups
      - 15-25, 25-35, 35-45, etc
    - Add more groups to be more precise
      - Too narrow though and chance becomes a larger coefficient
    - If we group as percentages we can combine Pie & Bar chart behavior
