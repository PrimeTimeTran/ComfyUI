$$f(x)=\frac{lim} {x\to2}\frac{x^2-2}{x-2}$$
The way Newton came up with it
- Tangent
	- A single point on a graph
	- Finding the slope at this point was the problem which gave birth to limits
	- instantaneous change
- Secants
	- Lines which cross a line at two points.
	- We select a few close to the tangent to get an close approximation to the value we're looking for, `m` at point `x`.
