## 4.8 Derivatives

### Optimization

1. We need to enclose a rectangular field with a fence. We have 500 feet of fencing material and a building is on one side of the field and so won’t need any fencing. Determine the dimensions of the field that will enclose the largest area.

2. We want to construct a box whose base length is 3 times the base width. The material used to build the top and bottom cost $10/ft2 and the material used to build the sides cost $6/ft2. If the box must have a volume of 50ft3 determine the dimensions that will minimize the cost to build the box.
   - Define optimization function
   - Define constraint
   - Solve for missing variable using one of the functions
   - Plug the function into the counterpart function
   - Find derivative of the function which we plugged one function into
   - After simplifying as much as we can for the derivative solve for it's variable, w
   - Using w find h, the last remaining var we don't have.

3. We want to construct a box with a square base and we only have 10 m2 of material to use in construction of the box. Assuming that all the material is used in the construction process determine the maximum volume that the box can have.

4. A manufacturer needs to make a cylindrical can that will hold 1.5 liters of liquid. Determine the dimensions of the can that will minimize the amount of material used in its construction.

5. We have a piece of cardboard that is 14 inches by 10 inches and we’re going to cut out the corners as shown below and fold up the sides to form a box, also shown below. Determine the height of the box that will give a maximum volume.

6. A printer needs to make a poster that will have a total area of 200 in2 and will have 1 inch margins on the sides, a 2 inch margin on the top and a 1.5 inch margin on the bottom as shown below. What dimensions will give the largest printed area?

7. A window is being built and the bottom is a rectangle and the top is a semicircle. If there is 12 meters of framing materials what must the dimensions of the window be to let in the most light?
