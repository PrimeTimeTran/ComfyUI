- Learning Paradigms

  - Supervised
  - Unsupervised
  - Reinforcement
    - Differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected
    - Instead focuses on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) & exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the long term reward, whose feedback might be incomplete or delayed.
    - Environment is typically in the form of Markov decision process (MDP)
