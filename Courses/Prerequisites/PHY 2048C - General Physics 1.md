# Overview
Key concepts of physics

1. **Classical Mechanics**: This is the study of motion and forces.
    - [[Newton's laws of motion]]
    - [[Kinematics]] (motion without regard to its causes)
    - Dynamics (the forces causing motion)
    - Conservation laws (e.g., conservation of energy and momentum)
    - Work and energy
    - Circular motion and gravitation
2. **[[Thermodynamics]]**: The study of heat and energy transfer.
    - [[Laws of thermodynamics]]
    - Heat transfer mechanisms (conduction, convection, radiation)
    - Thermodynamic processes (e.g., isothermal, adiabatic)
    - Heat engines and efficiency
3. **Electromagnetism**: The study of electricity and magnetism. Study of interaction between electrically charged particles.
    - Electric charge and electric fields
    - [[Maxwell Equations]]
    - [[Gauss's law]]
    - Electric potential and capacitance
    - Electric current and resistance
    - Magnetic fields and forces
    - Electromagnetic induction
4. **Optics**: The study of light and its behavior.
    - Reflection and refraction
    - Ray optics and lens systems
    - Wave optics (interference, diffraction)
    - Polarization
5. **Modern Physics**: This includes topics beyond classical physics.
    - Special relativity (time dilation, length contraction)
    - [[Quantum mechanics]] (particle-wave duality, uncertainty principle)
    - Atomic physics (structure of atoms, atomic spectra)
    - Nuclear physics (radioactivity, nuclear reactions)
6. **Mathematical Methods**: A solid understanding of mathematical tools used in physics is crucial.
    - Algebra and trigonometry
    - Calculus (differentiation, integration)
    - Vector calculus
    - [[Differential equations]]
