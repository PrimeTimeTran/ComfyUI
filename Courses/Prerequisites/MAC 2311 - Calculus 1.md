### Concrete
- [[Limits]]
  "What happens to a function as we approach a value"
- [[Derivatives]]
  Function which finds slope of an **original function**, $f(x)$, at some point(usually x).
- [[Integrations]]
  "Adding up tiny bits".
- **[[Differentiation Rules]]**: 
  These are rules that allow one to find the derivatives of various functions without having to resort to first principles. Examples include the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.
- **Antiderivatives**: 
  An antiderivative of a function is a function whose derivative is equal to the original function. Antiderivatives are essentially the reverse process of differentiation and are crucial in solving differential equations and evaluating integrals.
- **Applications of Calculus**: 
  Calculus has numerous applications across various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, biology, and computer science. Examples include optimization, motion analysis, population modeling, and signal processing.
- **[[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]**: 
  This theorem establishes a fundamental connection between differentiation and integration. It states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval and is integrable on that interval, then the definite integral of its derivative over that interval is equal to the difference of its values at the endpoints of the interval.
- **Limits at Infinity**: 
  Calculus also deals with the behavior of functions as the input approaches infinity or negative infinity. This concept is crucial for understanding asymptotic behavior and determining the end behavior of functions.
