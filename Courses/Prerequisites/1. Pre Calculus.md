Key concepts from precalculus that you should review before diving into calculus:

1. **Functions**: Understand the definition of a function, including domain, range, & how to evaluate functions.

2. **Trigonometry**: Review trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.), trigonometric identities, & solving trigonometric equations.

3. **Exponential & Logarithmic Functions**: Familiarize yourself with exponential functions, logarithmic functions, properties of logarithms, & solving exponential & logarithmic equations.

4. **Polynomial & Rational Functions**: Review polynomial functions (including factoring, long division, & synthetic division), rational functions, & their graphs.

5. **Limits**: Understand the concept of a limit, how to evaluate limits graphically, numerically, & algebraically.

6. **Graphing**: Practice graphing functions, including transformations, finding intercepts, asymptotes, & behavior at infinity.

7. **Algebraic Manipulations**: Be comfortable with algebraic manipulation techniques, such as simplifying expressions, solving equations, & inequalities.

8. **Vectors & Matrices**: Basic understanding of vectors, vector operations, & matrices.

9. **Conic Sections**: Familiarize yourself with the properties & equations of conic sections (circles, parabolas, ellipses, & hyperbolas).

10. **Complex Numbers**: Review complex numbers, operations with complex numbers, & solving equations involving complex numbers.

11. **Polar Coordinates**: Understand polar coordinates, graphing in polar coordinates, & converting between polar & rectangular coordinates.

12. **Sequences & Series**: Basic understanding of arithmetic & geometric sequences & series, including sums of finite & infinite series.

Reviewing these topics will help you build a strong foundation for calculus & ensure that you're well-prepared to tackle the new concepts you'll encounter in Calculus 1.

### Logarithms
The inverse of exponents

- Base is how quickly we grow
- Exponent is how much we changed
- x is the amount of time

1. Solve for x
$$
3^x = 27
$$

2. Solve for x
$$
\log_{27}(1/3) = x
$$
