1. The six trigometric functions:
	- Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Cotangent, Secant, Cosecant
		- Abbreviated: 
			- sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, csc
	- SOH, CAH, TOA
		- Sine: Opposite/Hypotenuse
		- Cosine: Adjacent/Hypotenuse
		- Tangent: Opposite/Adjacent
	- Reciprocals
		- Sine -> Cosecant: Hyp/Opp
		- Cosine -> Secant: Hyp/Adj 
		- Tangent -> Cotangent: Adjacent/Opposite
		  
	- Trig functions are properties of angles, not triangles
	- Trig functions are unitless.
	- Written and read as sin $\theta$ not sin $(\theta)$
	  
2. Cartesian Coordinates and Quandrants
	- I, II, III, IV
	- (+,+), (-, +), (-, -), (+, -)
3. Angle Measurements in Degrees and Radians
	- 0º - 360º
	- Quarters are 90º
	- 45º split each quandrant
	- Circumference = 2πr
	- 360º = 2πr radians
	- 180º = π radians

4. The Pythagorean Theorem
	- $a^2+b^2 = c^2$
5. The Unit Circle
    - Large, Medium, Small:
        - Large: $\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}$
        - Medium: $\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2}$
        - Small: $\frac {1}{2}$

To convert $\pi$ to degrees we multiply by $\frac {180^{{\degree}}}{\pi}$

Find the angle measurement in degrees that is equivalent to $\frac {7\pi}{6}$ radians.
## Convert from radians to degrees
To convert from radians to degrees we use:

$$\frac {180^{\degree}}{\pi}$$
Multiply it by the problem you're given.
$$
 \frac {7\pi}{6} \times \frac {180^{\degree}}{\pi} = \frac {1260\pi^{\degree}}{6\pi} = \frac {1260^{\degree}}{6} = 210^{\degree}
$$
## Convert from degrees to radians
To solve for $270^{\degree}$ we use:
$$\frac {\pi}{180^{\degree}}$$
Multiply times the problem given
$$
270^{\degree} \times \frac {\pi}{180^{\degree}} = \frac {3}{2}radians
$$
## Convert from degree to angle
To solve for something bigger than 360

1. Find the angle in radians that is coterminal with $795^{\degree}$
   
	- Subtract 360 until it's between 0 & 360
	- Multiply by 2 + degree/360 we want
	- Convert from degree to radians by multiplying by 
		  $\frac {\pi}{180^{\degree}}$
	- Result is $\frac {5\pi}{12}$
