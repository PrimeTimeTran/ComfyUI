From the Greek, Triangle and measure.

To convert $\pi$ to degrees we multiply by $\frac {180^{{\degree}}}{\pi}$

Find the angle measurement in degrees that is equivalent to $\frac {7\pi}{6}$ radians.
## Convert from radians to degrees
To convert from radians to degrees we use:

$$\frac {180^{\degree}}{\pi}$$
Multiply it by the problem you're given.
$$
 \frac {7\pi}{6} \times \frac {180^{\degree}}{\pi} = \frac {1260\pi^{\degree}}{6\pi} = \frac {1260^{\degree}}{6} = 210^{\degree}
$$
## Convert from degrees to radians
To solve for $270^{\degree}$ we use:
$$\frac {\pi}{180^{\degree}}$$
Multiply times the problem given
$$
270^{\degree} \times \frac {\pi}{180^{\degree}} = \frac {3}{2}radians
$$
## Convert from degree to angle
To solve for something bigger than 360

1. Find the angle in radians that is coterminal with $795^{\degree}$
   
	- Subtract 360 until it's between 0 & 360
	- Multiply by 2 + degree/360 we want
	- Convert from degree to radians by multiplying by 
		  $\frac {\pi}{180^{\degree}}$
	- Result is $\frac {5\pi}{12}$
