Sum bits of a quantity.  $$\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \,dx$$
![[demo-adding-up-sums.gif]]

- Opposite of derivative.
- "The derivative of the $f(x)$ is equal to f prime of x"
  $\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = f^1(x)$
- "The integral of f prime of x is $f(x)$":
  $\int{f}^1(x)dx = f(x)$
- "antiderivative of f prime"
	- Integration as finding the antiderivative
	- Finding the "original function" of the derivative
- Process of finding the accumulated area under a curve. The integral of a function represents the net accumulation of the function's values over a given interval. It has applications in computing areas, volumes, and solving differential equations.

The amount of change between two derivatives
- **integral**:
	- The continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations.Â 
- **integration**:
	- The process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operations of calculus, the other being differentiation.
How to find integral of differentiation?

Whats is the derivative?
$\frac {d}{dx}[x^4]$ = ?

Formula is:
$\int_a^b f(x) dx$

Subtract one from exponent. Divide by that expression:
$\frac {x^{3-1}}{3-1}$ = $\frac {x^2}{2}$
## [[Definite Integral]]
$\int_a^b f(x) dx$
- Has a & b
- Produces number
## [[Indefinite integral]]
$\int_ \,f(x) dx$
- Produces function
