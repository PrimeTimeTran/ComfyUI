A function which evaluates the slope of a line at point x on a graph.

#### The Power Rule
To find the the derivative of a monomial.

	$\frac{d}{dx}(x^n)= nx^{n-1}$

- x is by itself
- x is raised to a power.

#### Formula
Derivative function for a tangent.

$f^1(x) = \frac{lim}{h->0}(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h})$

#### The Chain Rule
