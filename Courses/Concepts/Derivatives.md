$$\frac{d}{dx}[x^n]$$
A function which evaluates the slope of a line at point x on a graph.
- Rate of change.
- Usually expressed as a function.
- Slope of the tangent line at a point, x.
- Functions that evaluate to slope of an original function at some value, usually x. 
	- Original Function: $f(x)$
		- Derivative: $f^1(x)$ 
		- Evaluates to slope of $f(x)$
- The derivative of a function represents its rate of change at any given point. Geometrically, it corresponds to the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. Derivatives are used in various applications such as optimization, modeling rates of change, and determining the behavior of functions.
