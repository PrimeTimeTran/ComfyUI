# How fast is the hive falling?
![[falling.gif]]

The derivative of a function represents its **rate of change** at any given point in the fall. Geometrically, it corresponds to the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. 
$$\frac{d}{dx}[x^n]$$
A function which evaluates the slope of a line at point x on a graph.
- Rate of change.
- Usually expressed as a function.
- Slope of the tangent line at a point, x.
- Functions that evaluate to slope of an original function at some value, usually x. 
	- Original Function: $f(x)$
		- Derivative: $f^1(x)$ 
		- Evaluates to slope of $f(x)$

Differing ways of notating derivatives with no values

# Formulas
Find derivatives easier than resorting to [[First Principles]].

## [[Constant Rule]]
The derivative of a constant function is 0
## [[Power Rule]]
Monomials can yield derivatives easily. We must remember the rules.
$$\frac{d}{dx}[x^n]= nx^{n-1}$$
- How did we change n?
## [[Sum Rule]]
## [[Difference Rule]]
## [[Constant Multiple Rule]]
## [[Quotient Rule]]
## [[Chain Rule]]


# Calculate Derivative from Equation
How to go from 1 to 2?

1. $f(x)=x^4âˆ’2x^2+1$
2. $f^1(x) = 4x^3-4x$

# Derivative Function for a Tangent
$$f^1(x) = \frac{lim}{h\to0}(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h})$$


# Application
Maximizing revenue for sales of a product.
- Price cheap means more units but less revenue per unit.
- Price expensive means less units but more revenue per unit.
We'll use $f^1s$ to calculate the optimized price.

Finding the minimized value is also useful
