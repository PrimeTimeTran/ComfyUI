As a hive drops from a tree how can we determine it's velocity?
- Define moment in time(x) that we want the velocity.
- Find slope of the tangent line(m).
Find out what happens as x approach a value.
$$\lim_{x \to 0} $$
Help us understand the value of a function which might be non existent
Does not exist(D.N.E.)

- Replaces "incalculable" functions: $2/0$
	- An equation which can be graphed. 
		- Find slope of a **single** point by looking at nearby points.
	- Use secants to ascertain slope at a **single** point.
	- Describe the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value. Limits are used to define derivatives and integrals.
	- "What happens to a function as we approach a value"
# How to evaluate limits?
1. [[Analytically]]
	1. [[First Principles]]
	2. Power Rule
	3. Constant Rule
2. [[Graphically]]
   Looking at the graphed $f(x)$

## Graphically
- If left & right side approaches are not the same then the limit does not exist
