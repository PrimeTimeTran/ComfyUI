**1st Law of Thermodynamics** - Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
**2nd Law of Thermodynamics** - For a spontaneous process, the entropy of the universe increases.

- Energy at lower entropy can do more work than energy at higher entropy
- Example: Energy in gasoline > energy in brakes from braking a car.
- Orderly energy is more useful than less orderly. Heat and exhaust cannot spontaneously become gasoline. Gasoline can become heat and exhaust
- Iso

**3rd Law of Thermodynamics** - A perfect crystal at zero Kelvin has zero entropy.
