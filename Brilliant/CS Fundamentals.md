2.2 CS Fundamentals


Making Decisions
- Decision Trees
	- Computers can only follow instructions

Searching for Solutions
- Brute force "can" prove but is sometimes impractical. 446 bridges in Pittsburg factorial cannot be computed

Parrallelism
- Solve problems **more quickly** by making progress on multiple different tasks at a time.
- Bakery Example:
	- Hiring an sous chef.
	- Preheat oven while prepping instead of prepping preheating and waiting.
- Pipelininig:
	- Form of parallelism where tasks are solved faster by having multiple tasks simultaneously at various levels of completion.
- "Faster"
	- Latency:
		- Time it takes to go from start to finish.
	- Throughput:
		- Amount of tasks that can complete during a given interval of time.

Order & Search
- Much faster to find items in sorted lists
	- Binary search
	- Sorted in useful way though, like title, not left word in the book.
- Indexes:
	- Store related info in a different sort
	- 

Naming:
- Key & Value
- DNS

Abstraction
- Manage Complexity
- Resource tradeoff(sometimes)
- Grouping systems
	- Humans
	- Computers
- Multi layer design is slower
- Abstraction has costs
	-
