Contour Map:

Partial Derivative:

Directional Derivatives:
It's the rate of change of a function at any point with a fixed direction

Double & Triple Integrals:
Get the volume under a surface
Inner then outter definite integral

Change of Variables & Jacobian:
Jacobian - Matrix of partial derivatives. Tool to change variables of a function.
Cartesian vs Polar

Vector Fields:
Vector is quantities with both magnitude and direction.
Assignment of a vector to a point in space.
The divergence of a vector field is a operator that measures how much a field spreads out from a point.

The curl is a vector field is another which measures the rotation of a point.

Line Integrals:

Integrating a function a long a curve.
