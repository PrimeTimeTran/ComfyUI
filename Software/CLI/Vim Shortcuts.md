I highly recommend [awesomevim](https://github.com/amix/vimrc?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-include-your-own-stuff).

Although I've used Vim on & off for a few years now spending 2 hours one morning trying all the snippets mentioned in that config may have just ended my use of VScode.

Smart way to move between windows (`<ctrl>j`Â etc.):

```vim
map <C-j> <C-W>j
map <C-k> <C-W>k
map <C-h> <C-W>h
map <C-l> <C-W>l
```
