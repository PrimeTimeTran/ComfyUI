## Network Devices
Take notes of [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiQR5rTSshw&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org). Maybe it'll help you earn a [CompTIA Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network) credential

#### Layer 1 Devices
  - Analog Modem. 
	  - Modularor Demodulartor.
	  - Single connection to network
	  - Concerned about wire
  - Hub
	- Takes in a single on a wire and broadcasts it.
	- Not common now adays
#### Layer 2 Devices
- Switch 
	- Application specific integrated circuit(ASIC) chip
	- Smart enough to know about whos "on" the network
	- Has few or many ports
	- Smarter than a hub, but can be both dumb & smart
	- Only LAN devices
- Wireless Access Point(WAP):
	- Only LAN devices
#### Layer 3 Devices
- Multilayer Switch
	- Layer 2 network switching services
	- OSI layer 3 or higher
	- ASIC chip(handles routing)
	- Can communicate with non network devices 
	- Highly programable, complex
	- Few or many ports
	- Super expensive
- Router:
	- Most common device for connecting multiple networks together.
	- Logical network information
	- Programming for decision making instead of switches
	- LAN & non local
	- Fewer ports than a switch(generally).
