### [[Electrical Power]]

How do we measure electrical power?

- Volts
	- Pressure which pushes electrical current through a wire.
- Amps
	- Measures strength of the current of electricity.
- Watts
	- Measure of power
- Hertz
	- Is rate of change in the directional flow of electricity, or how quickly it changes directional flow.
- [[Ohmz]]
	- Resistance or friction
### [[Circuit Board]]
- Conductive & Insulating areas.
- Connects & wires components to each other.
- Designed with pattern of traces, planes, etchings to one or more sheets of copper laminated between substrates.
### [[Electronic Components]]

What are the components of a circuit board? What do they do?

- Resisters
	- Pressurizes voltage / reduces current.
- Capacitors
	- Filtering power supply lines.
	- Tuning resonant circuits.
	- Blocking DC current while sending AC signals.
	- Store & release electrical charge to even out flow of current.
- Inductors
- Diodes
	- Conduct electricity in one direction.
	- Signal, LEDs, Rectifier, Zener.
- Transistors
	- Amplify, switches.
