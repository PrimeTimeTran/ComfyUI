## Electrical Components
The parts that give a circuit board life.

- Resisters
	- Pressurizes voltage / reduces current
- Capacitors
	- Filtering power supply lines
	- Tuning resonant circuits
	- Blocking DC current while sending AC signals
	- Store & release electrical charge to even out flow of current
- Inductors
- Diodes
	- Signal
	- LED:
		- Specific for illumination
	- Rectifier:
	- Zener:
		- Voltage regulation
		- Provide voltage reference
	- Function: 
		- Allow current to flow in one direction but not the other(within specification/rating)
		- Positive to negative
		- A -> K
- Transistors
	- Types
		- Bipolar
			- Biolar types main:
				- NPN, PNP
			- Bipolar Junction
		- Field Effect
	- Functions:
		- Amplify, 
		- Act as switch

### Types

- Active
	- Rely on a source of energy
	- Transistors, diodes
- Passive
	- Cannot introduce net energy into the circuit.
	- Resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers
