	- Encapsulating Security Payload(ESP)
		- Transparent/Tunnel: Between two devices or between two sites
		- Most popular
	- Internet Security Association and Key Management(ISAKMP)
		- Provides method for transferring security key and authentication data between systems outside of security key generating process, much more secure.
	- Generating Routing Encapsulating(GRE):
		- Can use wide variety of other network layer protocols
		- Often used to create subtunnel within IPsec connection. Only transfer IPsec packets. 
	- Point to Point Tunneling Protocol(PPTP):
		- Supports dial up VPN connections
		- Wasn't secure, but it's been updated by Microsoft
	- Transport Layer Security(TLS) Protocol:
		- Cryptographic protocol 
			- Asymmetric cryptograpgy
			- Negotiates a symmetrical security key
			- Largely replaced it's cousin secure socket layer protocol
			- Layer 5 and above
			- Most commonly creates secure encrypted internet session. SSL VPN
	- Secure Socket Layer(SSL) Protocol:
		- Largely been replaced.
		- v3.3 been to address issues but it may never catch up with TLS
