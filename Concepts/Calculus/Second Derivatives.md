Read "f double prime"
$$
f^{''}
$$
The symbol $f^{''}$ represents the derivative of the derivative, or **second derivative** of $f$

The second derivative of $f$ measures the rate of change of the first derivative $f^{'}$, so it c is a local max, then $f^{''}(c) <0$


## The Second Derivative Test 
So now we have a way of sorting critical points as local maxima or local minima — we call the process the second derivative test. 

In a nutshell, we find critical points by solving $f^{'}$ = 0.

We then plug them into $f^{''}$ if the result is positive, the critical point is a local min, and if the result is negative, the critical point is a local max.

## Shortcomings of the Second Derivative Test
While it can tell local maxima and minima apart, the second derivative can't tell us if these critical points are **global** extrema for $f$.
