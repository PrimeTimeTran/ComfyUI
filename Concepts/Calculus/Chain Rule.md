Find the derivatives of compositions.

The process of breaking a polynomial down into simpler parts always works, but that doesn't mean it's always practical.

This seems simple
$p(x)=(x^4−3x+1)^{100}$

But it means hundreds of terms
$p(x)=(x^{4})^{400}+⋯=x^{400}+...$

$\large\frac{d}{dx}[\,f(\,g(x)\,)\,]$

Functions inside functions
- Find derivative of outside function
$$
\frac {d}{dx}[x^2-3x]^5 = 5[x^2-3x]^4
$$
- Find derivative of inside function
$$
\frac {d}{dx}[x^2-3x] = 2x-3
$$
- Multiply values together
$$
5[x^2-3x]^4(2x-3)
$$

Ex 1.
Find the derivative

Find the derivatives:

1. 
2. $T(x) = tan^{-1}(2x) \sqrt[3]{1-3x^2}$
3. $f(z) = \sin(ze^z)$
