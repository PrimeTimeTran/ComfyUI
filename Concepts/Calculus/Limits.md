"The limit as x approaches 0, of $x^2$ is..."
$$\lim_{x \to 0} x^2 = $$


Help us understand the value of a function which might be non existent
Does not exist(D.N.E.)

- Replaces "incalculable" functions: $2/0$
	- An equation which can be graphed. 
		- Find slope of a **single** point by looking at nearby points.
	- Use secants to ascertain slope at a **single** point.
	- Describe the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value. Limits are used to define derivatives and integrals.
	- "What happens to a function as we approach a value"
# How to evaluate limits?
1. Analytically
	- [[First Principles]]
	- [[7 Rules of Differentiation]]
2. Graphically
   - Looking at the graphed $f(x)$

## Graphically
- If left & right side approaches are not the same then the limit does not exist.
- If we must lift our pen to graph the line then there's a hole.
