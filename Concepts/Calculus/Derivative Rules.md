Find derivatives more easily.

Simplify the process of finding derivatives with these rules/formulas
Memorizing a few rules makes live easy. 
## Constant Rule
![[Constant Rule]]
## [[Sum Rule]]
The derivative of the sum is the sum of the derivatives.
$$(f(x) + g(x))' = f'(x) + g'(x)$$
## [[Product Rule]]
The derivative factors multiplied is the sum of their derivatives.
$$
(f(x) \cdot g(x))' = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)
$$

## [[Power Rule]]
Transform $n$ by subtracting from exponent & multiplying with coefficient.
$$\frac{d}{dx}[x^n]= nx^{n-1}$$
## [[Chain Rule]]
Find derivative of outside & inside then multiple together

$$\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$$

## [[Quotient Rule]]
