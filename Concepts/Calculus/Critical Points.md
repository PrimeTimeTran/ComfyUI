Point the derivative evaluates to 0
$$f^1(c) = 0$$
They're also places in the graph where we hope to find the functions min & maxes

- **Local extremum**: Largest or smallest $f(x)$ compared to nearby points
- **Absolute extremum**: Largest or smallest $f(x)$ overall.

$f^{''}(0) < 0$ 
Is negative, max, concave down. 
The function has reached max, stopped, and is turning down.

$f^{''}(0) > 0$ 
Is positive, min, concave up. 
The function has reached min, stopped, and is turning up.
