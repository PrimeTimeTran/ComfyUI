## Gauss's Law of Electricity
The electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by that surface.
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}$$

## Gauss's Law of Magnetism
Also a form of Gauss's law, only with magnetic flux instead of electric flux.
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$

## Faraday's Law of Induction
A change in a magnetic field will induce an electromotive force in a loop of wire.
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
$$

## Amp√®re's Circuital Law (with Maxwell's Addition)
A current through a wire induces a magnetic field around a path surrounding the wire.
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
$$
