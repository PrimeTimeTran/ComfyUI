Displacement
Velocity
Acceleration

Vector quantity, not scalar. Magnitude

Motion in a straight line
- **Displacement:**
	- Initial position
	- Final position.
	- where you are and were. forward or backward
	- change in position is called displacement
- **Velocity:**
	- the change in position over time.
	- sorta like speed but includes direction, 
- **Acceleration:**
	- Change
