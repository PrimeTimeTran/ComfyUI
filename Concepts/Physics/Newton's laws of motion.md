**Newton's laws of motion** are three [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law "Scientific law") that describe the relationship between the [motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion "Motion") of an object and the [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") acting on it. These laws, which provide the basis for **Newtonian mechanics**, can be paraphrased as follows:


1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
2. The net force on a body is equal to the body's instantaneous [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") multiplied by its instantaneous mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") changes with time.
3. If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.





$F = ma$

$a = f/m$



## Law of universal gravitation
$F = \frac {Gm_{1} {m}_{2}} {d^2}$

Allows us to determine the motion of heavenly bodies.
