Force carrying particles.

Fermions constantly swap [[Bosons]].

# [[Electromagnetism]]
Acts on anything that carries an electric charge.

Photon
Has electric field

# [[Strong Force]]
Holds together nuclei of atoms. Responsible for nuclear fission. Gives energy released in explosion

Gluon 
Has Gluon field. Doesn't spread out radially. 
Produces a flux tube. String like object which only ends when it finds another quark. 

# [[Weak Force]]
About decay.
Acts on subatomic distance space. 
Makes it so quarks can change identity. Releasing 1 electron & neutrino.  Neutron can become proton. Radioactive B decay.

Responsible for nuclear fusion of sun.  

Why heavier matter particles decay and become matter as we know it.
W Boson 
Z Boson
Gluon

Acts on all particles. 
The only force neutrinos feel.

# [[Higgs Boson]]
None of the fundamental particles have mass. It gives all [[fermions]] have mass. 

Higgs field is cosmic molasses. Spread throughout the universe. Traps matter particles. Giving them what appears to be mass.
