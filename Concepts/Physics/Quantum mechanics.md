**Schrödinger Equation**: This is the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, describing how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\Psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}|\Psi(t)\rangle
$$
- i is the imaginary unit,
- ℏ is the reduced Planck constant,
- $\frac {a}{at}$​ is the partial derivative with respect to time,
- Ψ(t) is the wave function of the system,
- $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, representing the total energy of the system.

**Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**: This principle doesn't come from an equation per se, but it's a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics.
$$
\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$
- $\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position,
- $\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in momentum.

**Dirac Equation**: Describes the behavior of fermions, specifically electrons in quantum mechanics, taking into account both special relativity and quantum mechanics.
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = (c \alpha \cdot \hat{p} + \beta m c^2)\Psi
$$

- c is the speed of light,
- $\alpha \, \&  \, \beta$ are 4x4 matrices called the Dirac matrices,
- $\hat{p}$ is the momentum operator,
- $m$ is the rest mass of the particle.

**Klein-Gordon Equation**: Another relativistic wave equation, describes spin-0 particles such as mesons.
$$
\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 + \frac{m^2c^2}{\hbar^2}\right)\Psi = 0
$$
- $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.
