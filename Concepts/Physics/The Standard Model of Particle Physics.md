# Standard Model of Particle Physics
$$
z = \int {D}(Fields)\exp\left( i\int d^4 x \sqrt{-g}(R-F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}-G_{\mu\nu}G^{\mu\nu}-W_{\mu\nu})W^{\mu\nu} + \sum_{i} \psi_{i} \centernot{D} \psi_{i} + D_{\mu}H^tD^\mu H - V(H - \lambda_{ij}\overline{\psi}_{i}H\psi j)\right )
$$

Describes how everything is bound together 12 types of matter particles

- 3 forces
	- Actually 4
	- Gravity: We understand the least.
		- General Relativity
		- Don't know how to incorporate it into classical worlds

Quantum Field Theory
Made up of fields not particles. Fluid like and spread throughout all of space. They obey the law of physics.

- Bound together by a special particle called Higgs Boson

[[Two Types of Particles]]
- Fermions: Matter particles
	- Electrons, Up Quarks, Down Quarks, Electron Neutrino
- Boson: Force: the force particles
	- 
[[Bosons]]
