Pauli Exclusion Principle: Cannot put two on top of each other in space:

# Three types of Matter Particles

- Electron:
- Up Quark
- Down Quark

## 

- Proton & Neutron are 3 quarks:
	- Proton: 2 Ups & 1 Down
	- Neutron 2 Downs & 1 Up
- Protons & Neutrons = Nucleus
	- Protons, Neutrons, Electrons = Atom
	- Neutrino:



## 2nd & 3rd Generation Particles
For reasons not fully understand physics has copies of each of them. We can create but they quickly decay.

Electrons:
- Electron
- Tau
- Muon

Down quark:
- Strange Quark
- Bottom Quark

Up Quark
- Charm Quark
- Top Quark

Electron Neutrino:
Light, barely react to anything.
- Muon Neutrino
- Tau Neutrino
  
  
The math proves these have to exist. We don't understand why there are 3 generations and not 4 or 5

All particles are described by the same equation, the Dirac equation.
