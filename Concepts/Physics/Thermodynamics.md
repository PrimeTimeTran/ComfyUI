- Open System
- Closed System
- Isolated System
	- Refridgerator isn't isolated because it heats up the room(using electricity) to create cool space.




Thermal Energy

temperature: average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules
thermal energy: TOTAL kinetic energy of atoms and molecules


Entropy: Measure of disorder. Or the info required to describe the microstates of a system.
One way flow of entropy appears to be the only reason there is a forward flow of time.
