## Security Devices

### Firewall
- Police Force of network
- \Can be on routers(software)
- Can be it's own device
- Operates on layers 2,3,4,7.
- Can block packets from entering or leaving(stateless inspection).
	- Examines every packet and compares to a set of rules
- State of connection between networks
	- Connection to internal to external.
### Intrusion Detection System(IDS)
- Passive system 
- Designed to inform network admin
- Log files, text messages, email.
- Cannot stop or prevent.
- Recieves copy of all traffic and compares to set of standards
	- Signature: Evaluates for known malware or attack signatures
	- Anomaly: Evaluates network traffic for suspicious changes
	- Policy: Evalutes network traffic against a specific declared security policy.
 - May be deployed at host level:
	 - Host based intrusion detection system(HIDS)
### Intrustion Prevention System(IPS)
- Automated system to stop things
- Informs network admins though log files
- All traffic must flow through IPS
- Like IDS, all traffic is compared to standards
- Programmed to actively do something
	- Block offending IP addresses
	- Close vulnerable interface
	- Terminate network session
	- Redirect attack
	- more
### VPN Concentrator
- Allows for secure VPN connections to network
- Provide tunneling & encryption depending on config
- Layers 2, 3, 7
- Mostly use network layer, providing IPsec encryption through a secure tunnel.
