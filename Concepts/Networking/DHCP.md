## DHCP in the Network
### Static vs Dynamic IP Addressing
- Computer told it's IP config from 
- DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Isn't require to be on the same local network segment.
- It'll get it from one of two ways
	- Statically(manually set)
		- Works fine for small & stable.
		- Error prone when larger.
		- Admin assigns IP & subnet mask to each host(PC, router, etc)
		- Admin also sssigns default gateway location & DNS server location to each host(required if access to outside networks are allowed or human friendly names are used)
		- Each time a change is made(new gateway established), each ip config on each host must be updated. Thus cumbersome
	- Dynamically(through a service like DHCP).
		- Config DHCP
		- Automates
		- Listens on specific port for IP info requests. 
			- Responds with requested info
### How DHCP works
- Upon boot PC sends DHCP discovery packet.
	- Broadcasts to 255.255.255.255:67 UDP
- DHCP listens on that port. Once it receives it responds with offer packet. Sent back to the MAC address of the machine requesting help. Sent on port UDP 68.
- If the device uses network, it'll send request packet
- The DHCP server receives request packet then responds with acknowledgement packet
- Once device receives acknowledgement packet it updates it's IP config to reflect the info in the packet.  
### Components and processes of DHCP
#### Address Scope
- Admin can reserve a pool of addresses.
- Admin configures the IP address range with one that is available to be handed out.
- Should only be used on devices that don't change IP addresses
#### Leases 
- Hands out info
- But limits the time for the config
- Admin can configure how long that config is good for
- Config
	- Expiration
	- Default Gateway Location
	- DNS server addresses
	- Time server address
	- Many additional options
#### Preferrered IP Config
- Devices generally prefer previous IP Address
