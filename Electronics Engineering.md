## [[Electrical Power]]
How do we calculate electrical power?

- Volts
	- Pressure which pushes electrical current through a wire.
- Amps
	- Measures strength of the current of electricity.
- Watts
	- Measure of power
- Hertz
	- Is rate of change in the directional flow of electricity, or how quickly it changes directional flow.

## [[Electronic Components]]


- Resisters
	- Pressurizes voltage / reduces current
- Capacitors
	- Filtering power supply lines
	- Tuning resonant circuits
	- Blocking DC current while sending AC signals
	- Store & release electrical charge to even out flow of current
- Inductors
- Diodes
	- Conduct electricity in one direction. Lights
- Transistors
	- Amplify, switches,
