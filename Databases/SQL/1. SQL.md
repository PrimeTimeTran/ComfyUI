## Queries

- `SELECT`
- `WHERE`
	- Filter results.
- `GROUP BY`
	- Create summary rows
- `ORDER BY`
	- 
- `HAVING`
	- Filter after grouping
- Aggregates
- Advanced Functions
	- `IF`
	- `IFNULL`
	- `ISNULL`
	- `CASE WHEN THEN END`
### [[Select]]
- Return all with `*`.
- Specify fields to return by naming.
- Alias fields with `AS`.
- Remove duplicates with `DISTINCT`.
- Create fields with `AS` and aggregates.
- Limit with `TOP`.
### [[From]]
- Identify which table we want to pull data from
- Can alias from
- Can select from multiple tables
### [[Join]]
- Grab fields from any table.
- Combine records of multiple tables.
- Can join & join again:
	- First join then left join
#### [[On]]
- Specify field to match records of differing tables with.
- If not used then SQL will map all records from right table to each record in left table.
- Can also use aggregates here
	- `AND`: 
		- Helpful when a primary key is missing.
#### [[Inner]]
- Default type
	- Returns records if there's a match in both tables.
#### [[Left Join]]
- Keep all records of left/first table regardless of missing companion record in right/second table.
#### [[Right Join]]
- Keep all records of right/second table regardless of missing companion record in left/first table.
#### [[Outer Join]]
- 
### [[Where]]
- Filter select results.
- Use `IS` when searching for null specifically
- Length can be used to check length of string
- Comparison Operators
	- =
	- `>`
	- `<`
	- `>=`
	- `<=`
	- `<>`
- Logical Operators
	- `AND`
	- `OR`
	- `NOT`
	- `BETWEEN`
	- `EXISTS`
	- `LIKE`
	- `ILIKE`
	- `IN`
- "Before" aggregation:
	- Similar to `having` but acts before.
### [[Group By]]
- Create summary rows.
- Return single values for each group of records.
### [[Having]]
- Filter/where clause of `group by`.
### [[Aggregates]]
- `COUNT`
	- Must be used with `group by`.
- `MIN`
- `MAX`
- `AVG`
- `SUM`
### [[Update]]
- `UPDATE` & `SET` to update records.
### [[Delete]]
- `DELETE` `FROM` *table_name* `WHERE` *condition*.
### [[With]]
	- Common Table Expression(C.T.E.)
	- Allows you to create a select statement that returns a temp result
### [[Window functions]]
- Perform a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related.
- Similar to aggregate but doesn't combine results.
- Maintains seperate identify for result.
- Examples:
	- `OVER`:
		- Defines how to partition the results for this row
	- `LAG`:
		- How many rows behind to grab
	- `LEAD`:
		- How many rows ahead to grab
### Advanced Functions
- Case, when, then, else, end
	- Instead of `is` must use "=".
### Subqueries
- Nest queries within each other.
### [[Union]]
- Combine two `SELECT` into one result
