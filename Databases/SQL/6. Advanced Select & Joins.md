## Advanced Select & Joins

### 1731. The Number of Employees Which Report to

- Reuse the table to compare the fields we need per requirements
  ```sql
		select m.employee_id as employee_id, m.name,
		count(*) as reports_count,
		round(avg(sub.age), 0) as average_age
		from employees m
		join employees sub
		on m.employee_id = sub.reports_to
		group by employee_id
		order by employee_id
	```

### 1789. Primary Department for Each Employee

- Use `WHERE IN` with `OR` to specify two differing criteria(which match the two requested)
  ```sql
		SELECT DISTINCT employee_id, department_id
		FROM Employee
		WHERE employee_id IN (
			SELECT employee_id
			FROM Employee
			GROUP BY employee_id
			HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
		)
		OR primary_flag = 'Y'
		ORDER BY employee_id;
	```
- Use `UNION` to join two seperate selects works too.
	```sql
		select employee_id, department_id from employee
		group by employee_id
		having count(employee_id) = 1
		union
		select employee_id, department_id from employee where primary_flag = 'Y'
	```

### 610. Triangle Judgement

- Memorize the properties of a triangle.
- Two sides must sum to greater than the length of the 3rd.
  ```sql
		SELECT *, IF(x+y>z and y+z>x and z+x>y, "Yes", "No") as triangle FROM Triangle
	```

### 180. Consecutive Numbers

- Use window function to create temp table.
- Use `OVER` & `LEAD` to create new field on each row.
- Select `DISTINCT` num's that meet requirements.
  ```sql
		with cte as (
			select num,
			lead(num,1) over() num1,
			lead(num,2) over() num2
			from logs
		)
		select distinct num ConsecutiveNums 
		from cte where num = num1 and num = num2
	```
