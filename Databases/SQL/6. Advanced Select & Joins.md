## Advanced Select & Joins

### 1731. The Number of Employees Which Report to

- Reuse the table to compare the fields we need per requirements
  ```sql
  	select m.employee_id as employee_id, m.name,
  	count(*) as reports_count,
  	round(avg(sub.age), 0) as average_age
  	from employees m
  	join employees sub
  	on m.employee_id = sub.reports_to
  	group by employee_id
  	order by employee_id
  ```

### 1789. Primary Department for Each Employee

- Use `WHERE IN` with `OR` to specify two differing criteria(which match the two requested)
  ```sql
  	SELECT DISTINCT employee_id, department_id
  	FROM Employee
  	WHERE employee_id IN (
  		SELECT employee_id
  		FROM Employee
  		GROUP BY employee_id
  		HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
  	)
  	OR primary_flag = 'Y'
  	ORDER BY employee_id;
  ```
- Use `UNION` to join two seperate selects works too.
  ```sql
  	select employee_id, department_id from employee
  	group by employee_id
  	having count(employee_id) = 1
  	union
  	select employee_id, department_id from employee where primary_flag = 'Y'
  ```

### 610. Triangle Judgement

- Memorize the properties of a triangle.
- Two sides must sum to greater than the length of the 3rd.
  ```sql
  	SELECT *, IF(x+y>z and y+z>x and z+x>y, "Yes", "No") as triangle FROM Triangle
  ```

### 180. Consecutive Numbers

- Use window function to create temp table.
- Use `OVER` & `LEAD` to create new field on each row.
- Select `DISTINCT` num's that meet requirements.
  ```sql
  	with cte as (
  		select num,
  		lead(num,1) over() num1,
  		lead(num,2) over() num2
  		from logs
  	)
  	select distinct num ConsecutiveNums
  	from cte where num = num1 and num = num2
  ```

### 1164. Product Price at a Given Date

- `UNION` two queries.
  - All products with price changes before date.
  - All distinct products with prices changed after date. Use default price.
  ```sql
  	select distinct product_id, 10 as price
  	from products
  	where product_id not in(
  			select distinct product_id
  			from products
  			where change_date <='2019-08-16'
  	)
  	union
  	select product_id, new_price as price
  	from products
  	where (product_id, change_date) in (
  			select product_id,
  			max(change_date)
  			from products
  			where change_date <='2019-08-16'
  			group by product_id
  	)
  ```

### 1204. Last Person to Fit in the Bus

- Self join.
- Join on *turn* with each rider and next rider.
- Keep running total using `SUM`.
- Order by weight `DESC`.
- Take `LIMIT` 1 per requirements.
  ```sql
		SELECT
		q1.person_name
		FROM Queue q1 JOIN Queue q2 ON q1.turn >= q2.turn
		GROUP BY q1.turn
		HAVING SUM(q2.weight) <= 1000
		ORDER BY SUM(q2.weight) DESC
		LIMIT 1
	```

### 1907. Count Salary Categories

- `UNION` with 3 selects.
  ```sql
		SELECT "Low Salary" AS category,
			sum(income < 20000) AS accounts_count
		FROM Accounts
		UNION
		SELECT "Average Salary" AS category,
			sum(income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000) AS accounts_count
		FROM Accounts
		UNION
		SELECT "High Salary" AS category,
			sum(income > 50000) AS accounts_count
		FROM Accounts;
	```
