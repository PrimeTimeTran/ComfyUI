## Basic Joins

### 1378. Replace Employee Id with the Unique Identifier

- Return all records from left/first table regardless of if there's a corresponding value in the second table.
  ```sql
  select empu.unique_id, name from employees emp left join employeeuni empu on emp.id = empu.id;
  ```

### 1068. Product Sales Analysis I

- Join on `id`.
  ```sql
    select product_name, year, price
    from sales as s
    join product as p
    on s.product_id = p.product_id
  ```

### 1581. Customer who visited but did not make any transactions

- Find null existance in one table.
- Group results and count records.
  ```sql
    select customer_id, count(v.visit_id) as count_no_trans
    from visits v
    left join transactions t
    on v.visit_id = t.visit_id
    where transaction_id is null
    group by customer_id
  ```

### 197. Rising Temperature

- Alias a table to compare itself with itself.
- Use `DATEDIFF` to compare different dates of records.
  ```sql
    SELECT w1.id
    FROM Weather w2, Weather w1
    WHERE w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature AND DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
  ```

### 1661. Average Time of Process Per Machine

How to flatten our results into a few rows?

- Alias to reuse table.
- Combine `avg` & `round` for arithmetic.
- Group by to combine results.
  ```sql
  	SELECT s.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(e.timestamp-s.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
  	FROM Activity s JOIN Activity e ON
  	s.machine_id = e.machine_id AND s.process_id = e.process_id AND
  	s.activity_type = 'start' AND e.activity_type = 'end'
  	GROUP BY s.machine_id
  ```

### 577. Employee Bonus

- Include null values.
- Include all of left table regardless of null values in right table.

  ```sql
  	select name, bonus from employee left join bonus on bonus.empId = employee.empId where bonus.bonus < 1000 or bonus is null
  ```

### 1280. Students and Examinations

- Multi table join.
- Count number of records with aggregate `count`.
- Group by student and subject because we want to know how many times each student took each subject's exam.
  ```sql
  	select s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name, count(e.subject_name) as attended_exams
  	from students s
  	join subjects sub left join examinations e
  	on e.student_id = s.student_id
  	and sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
  	group by student_id, subject_name
  	order by student_id, subject_name
  ```

### 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

- Correlated subquery combined with aggregate `count` and filter `having`.
  ```sql
  	select name from employee
  	where id in
  	(select managerId from Employee
  	group by managerId
  	having count(*)>=5)
  ```

### 1934. Confirmation Rate

- Use conditional to assign values.
- Use aggregates to make calculations.
  ```sql
  	select s.user_id, round(avg(if(c.action = 'confirmed', 1, 0)), 2) as confirmation_rate
  	from signups s
  	left join confirmations c
  	on s.user_id = c.user_id
  	group by user_id
  ```
