## Basic Aggregate Functions

### 620. Not Boring Movies

- Numeric functions are cool
  ```sql
  	select id, movie, description, rating
  	from cinema
  	where mod(id, 2) = 1 and description != 'boring'
  	order by rating desc
  ```

### 1251. Average Selling Price

- Guard against null
- Use `BETWEEN` to ensure dates fall within domain
  ```sql
  	select p.product_id, IFNULL(ROUND(SUM(units*price)/SUM(units), 2), 0) as average_price
  	from prices p LEFT join UnitsSold u
  	on p.product_id = u.product_id and
  	purchase_date between start_date and end_date
  	group by product_id
  ```

### 1075. Project Employees I

- Aggregate the totals
  ```sql
  	select project_id, round(avg(e.experience_years), 2) as average_years
  	from project p join employee e on p.employee_id = e.employee_id
  	group by project_id
  ```

### 1633. Percentage of Users Attended a Contest

- Be careful the math matches the requirements
  ```sql
  	select
  	contest_id,
  	round(count(user_id) * 100 / (select count(user_id) from users), 2) as percentage
  	from Register
  	group by contest_id
  	order by percentage desc,contest_id
  ```

### 1211. Queries Quality and Percentage

- `ROUND`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `CAST`, `CASE` all matter here
  ```sql
  	select
  	query_name,
  	round(avg(cast(rating as decimal) / position), 2) as quality,
  	round(sum(case when rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end) * 100 / count(*), 2) as poor_query_percentage
  	from queries
  	where query_name is not null
  	group by
  	query_name;
  ```

### 1193. Monthly Transactions I

- `SUM` a ton
  ```sql
  	select
  	substr(trans_date,1,7) as month,
  	country, count(id) as trans_count,
  	sum(case when state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END) as approved_count,
  	sum(amount) as trans_total_amount,
  	sum(case when state = 'approved' then amount else 0 END) as approved_total_amount
  	from transactions
  	group by month, country
  ```

### 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

- Use `WHERE` in to filter records which would produce errors.
  ```sql
  	select round(avg(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100, 2) as immediate_percentage
  	from delivery
  	where (customer_id, order_date) in (
  	select customer_id, min(order_date)
  	from delivery
  	group by customer_id
  	)
  ```

### 550. Game Play Analysis IV

- Use `date_sub` to subtract days from dates.
- Use `interval 1 day` to define how much time.

  ```sql
  	SELECT
  		ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
  	FROM
  		Activity
  	WHERE
  	(player_id, DATE_SUB(event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY))
  	IN (
  		SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id
  	)
  ```
