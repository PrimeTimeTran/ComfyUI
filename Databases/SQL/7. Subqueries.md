## Subqueries

### 1978. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

- `SELF.JOIN`
- Use `NOT IN` to compare manager_id to employee_id.
```sql
select e.employee_id from employees e
where e.salary < 30000 and e.manager_id not in (
    select m.employee_id from employees m
)
order by e.employee_id
```

### 626. Exchange Seats

- Use window `ROW_NUMBER` & `OVER` to generate row numbers
- Use `ORDER BY` to swap seats of each row with `IF`.
- Use `MOD` to swap on id.
  - Swap evens & odds.
  ```sql
  	SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER() id, student
  	FROM seat
  	ORDER BY IF(MOD(id, 2) = 0, id-1, id+1)
  ```

### 1341. Movie Rating

- `UNION` two `SELECT`.
- Use `()` around the each `SELECT`.
- `USING` is like `ON` but must wrap the field with `()`
  ```sql
  	(select name as results
  	from users
  	join movierating
  	on users.user_id = movierating.user_id
  	group by name
  	having count(movierating.user_id)
  	order by count(*) desc, name
  	limit 1)

  	union all

  	(select title as results from movierating
  	join movies using(movie_id)
  	WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR_MONTH FROM created_at) = 202002
  	group by title
  	order by avg(rating) desc, title
  	limit 1)
  ```

### 1321. Restaurant Growth

- Select intervals greater than the min of the lowest interval, 7 days.
- Calculate _amount_ using subquery on _visited_on_ field.
- Use `DATE_SUB` to
  ```sql
  	SELECT
  	visited_on,
  	(
  		SELECT SUM(amount)
  		FROM customer
  		WHERE visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on
  	) AS amount,
  	ROUND(
  	(
  		SELECT SUM(amount) / 7
  		FROM customer
  		WHERE visited_on BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY) AND c.visited_on
  	),
  	2
  	) AS average_amount
  	FROM customer c
  	WHERE visited_on >= (
  		SELECT DATE_ADD(MIN(visited_on), INTERVAL 6 DAY)
  		FROM customer
  	)
  	GROUP BY visited_on;
  ```

### 602. Friend Requests II: Who Has The Most Friends Requests

- `UNION ALL` requester & accepter.
- Use CTE to create table to make subsequent query on.
- Query _id_ & _count_ from CTE `GROUP BY` _id_ and `ORDER BY` _count_ `DESC` & `LIMIT` to 1 to meet requirements.
  ```sql
  	with base as (select requester_id id from requestaccepted
  	union all
  	select accepter_id id from requestaccepted)
  	select id, count(*) num from base group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 1
  ```

### 585. Investments in 2016

- `PARTITION` to select from those who have 2015 investment accounts.
- `SELECT` rows that have 2 or more matching records for field CTN1, windows where there are more than 1 matching record in the window over the query.
  - `COUNT` results
- `PARTITION` to select lat & lon from table.
- `SELECT` rows which have CTN2 of 1, which means they don't have any matching lat & lon records to compete against.

  - `COUNT` results

  ```sql
  	SELECT ROUND(SUM(TIV_2016),2) AS TIV_2016
  	FROM
  	(SELECT *,
  		COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY TIV_2015) AS CNT1,
  		COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY LAT, LON) AS CNT2
  		FROM INSURANCE
  	) AS TBL
  	WHERE CNT1 >= 2 AND CNT2 = 1
  ```

### 185. Department Top Three Salaries

- Subquery for employees with higher salaries than the outer query employee
- Return users who have less than 3 employees that have greater salary than them in their department.
  ```sql
  	select department.name department, e1.name employee, salary
  	from employee e1
  	join department
  	on e1.departmentId = department.id
  	where 3 > (
  		select count(distinct e2.salary)
  		from employee e2
  		where e2.salary > e1.salary
  		and e1.departmentId = e2.departmentId
  	)
  ```
