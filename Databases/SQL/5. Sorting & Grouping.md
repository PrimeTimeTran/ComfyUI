## Sorting & Grouping

### 2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught By Each

- Use `DISTINCT` to ensure we get unique subjects and `COUNT` them.
- Use `GROUP BY` which is required by `COUNT`.

  ```sql
		select teacher_id, count(distinct subject_id) as cnt
		from teacher
		group by teacher_id
	```

### 1141. User Activity for the Past 30 Days I

- `DATE_SUB`  & `INTERVAL` to query a range
  ```sql
		select activity_date as day, count(distinct user_id) as active_users
		from activity
		WHERE activity_date >= DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY)
		AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
		group by activity_date
	```

### 1070. Product Sales Analysis III

- Use subquery to filter for just one year
  ```sql
		select sales.product_id, year as first_year, quantity, price 
		from sales 
		where (sales.product_id, year) in ( 
			select sales.product_id, min(year) 
			from sales join product on sales.product_id = product.product_id 
			group by product_id 
		)
	```

### 596. Classes More Than 5 Students

- Use `USING` to filter classes which don't meet requirements.
  ```sql
		select class from courses group by class having count(student) >= 5
	```

### 1729. Find Followers Count

- Count distinct follower_id's for the individual users
  ```sql
		select user_id, count(distinct follower_id) as followers_count
		from followers
		group by user_id
	```

### 619. Biggest Single Number

- Combine a subquery with `GROUP BY` & having to meet requirements
  ```sql
		select max(num) as num
		from (select num from mynumbers group by num having count(num) = 1)
		as unique_numbers
	```

### 1045. Customers Who Bought All Products

- Use subquery to collect all product keys and compare that to disticnt product_key's of each customer.
  ```sql
		SELECT customer_id FROM Customer GROUP BY customer_id
		HAVING COUNT(distinct product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(product_key) FROM Product)
	```
