# First Derivative Test
The First Derivative Test states that if we are given a continuous and differentiable function f, and c is a critical number of function f, then f(c) can be classified as follows:

- If f’ (x) changes from negative to positive at c, then f(c) is a relative minimum.
- If f’ (x) changes from positive to negative at c, then f(c) is a relative maximum.
  

We just have to graph our data and then look for outliers in the line.

![[Critical Points]]

# [[Second Derivative Test]]
Can determine local min & max but not global min & max

Consider 
$f(x) = x^3$

## [[Saddle Point]]
Are where the line seems about to turn but then corrects and continues.


Not all critical points where $f''(c) = 0$ are saddle points though

Consider 
$f(x) = x^4$


# Higher Order Derivative
Written as
$$f^n(x)$$

Is best described in the context of motion.

Let's say the smooth function $x(t)$ describes the position of an object moving along a one-dimensional track at time $t$.

Then $v(t) = x'(t)$ is the instantaneous velocity, and the instantaneous rate of change of the velocity at time $t$ is called the **acceleration**, $a(t)$.

What is the acceleration in terms of $x(t)$?

$$
x''(t)
$$

The instantaneous rate of change of $v$ at time $t$ is

$$
v'(t) = \frac {d}{dt}[ x'(t)  ] = x''(t)
$$
the second derivative of $x(t)$.
